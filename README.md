- Included CI (Continuous Integration) with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org).
- Linting with [Eslint](https://eslint.org/).

## Software Requirements

- Node.js **8+**
- MongoDB **3.6+** (Recommended **4+**)

## How to install

### Using Git (recommended)

1.  Clone the project from github. Change "myproject" to your project name.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maitraysuthar/rest-api-nodejs-with-mongodb.git ./myproject
```

### Using manual download ZIP

1.  Download repository
2.  Uncompress to your directory

### Install npm dependencies after installing (Git or manual download)

```bash
cd myproject
npm install
```

### Setting up environments

1.  You will find a file named `.env.example` on root directory of project.
2.  Create a new file by copying and pasting the file and then renaming it to just `.env`
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
3.  The file `.env` is already ignored, so you never commit your credentials.
4.  Change the values of the file to your environment. Helpful comments added to `.env.example` file to understand the constants.

## How to run

### Running API server locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will know server is running by checking the output of the command `npm run dev`

```bash
Connected to mongodb:YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
App is running ...

Press CTRL + C to stop the process.
```

**Note:** `YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING` will be your MongoDB connection string.

## Tests

### Running Test Cases

```bash
npm test
```

You can set custom command for test at `package.json` file inside `scripts` property. You can also change timeout for each assertion with `--timeout` parameter of mocha command.

### Creating new tests

If you need to add more test cases to the project just create a new file in `/test/` and run the command.
